Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. And the class name should always start with an uppercase first letter.  
Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.  
Each code statement must end with a semicolon (;)  
Text inside println() must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".  
print() method is also similar to println(). But it does not insert a new line at the end of the output.
